# inf0's (terrible) media pipeline

Just a set of tools I use when doing instrumentals. Will add onto whenever I feel it's needed.

This is mainly so I don't (1) need to remember `ffmpeg` commands, and (2) need to open Audacity for automatable tasks.

## Requirements

- `ffmpeg`
- `ffprobe`

## Notes

I _could_ make aliases and functions within my computer's shell, but since I'm switching constantly between 3 computers (windows and mac), I'd rather just have fun and make a little binary. This makes it simpler to just download/update and use.

It's also more fun writing scripts and tools - which may or may not be forgotten, and rewritten in a better manner sooner or later.
